[![Buy at Amazon](/images/a_logo_17.gif)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691121273/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20) Rucker, Rudy. _Infinity and the Mind: The Science and Philosophy of the Infinite_. Princeton University Press, 2004. ISBN: 9780691121277.

(If you have the 1995 printing, that's okay too; all you'll be missing is a new preface by the author.)

Other readings come from a variety of sources and are detailed in the [Readings]({{% getpage "courses/24-118-paradox-infinity-spring-2013/sections/readings" %}}) section.
